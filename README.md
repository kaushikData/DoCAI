# DoCAI

## Abstract:

DoCAI (Document Conversational AI) is an AI-powered document analyzing tool and question-answer chatbot. Given a URL address, document or free text, DoCAI analysis them, provides insights and answers questions in the context of the document using Natural Language Processing. Any user/professional referring a large set of documents on a daily basis can leverage DoCAI to quickly go through and assimilate a large amount of information.
