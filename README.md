# DoCAI

## Abstract:

DoCAI (Document Conversational AI) is an AI-powered document analyzing tool and question-answering chatbot. Given a URL address, document or free text, DoCAI analysis them, answers questions in the context of the document and provides insights like topic distribution of the document using Natural Language Processing. Any user/professional referring a large set of documents on a daily basis can leverage DoCAI to quickly go through and assimilate large amounts of information.

## Question Answer Bot:

The goal of building question answering model in DoCAI is to find the text for any new question and context provided. The answer to a question in SQuAD is always a part of the context and also a continuous span of context. 

The first step is to convert the SQuAD JSON data into Pandas Dataframe. 

## Insights generated by DoCAI:

Insights given by DoCAI include topic distribution of documents (https://github.com/kaushikData/Document-Classification-Using-Wikipedia-Data) and sentiment of documents.
